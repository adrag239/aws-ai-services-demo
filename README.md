# AWS AI Services 

With AWS AI services, you can add capabilities like image and video analysis, natural language processing, personalized recommendations and translation, virtual assistants, and speech recognition. You can use each service standalone, or you can use them together to build a sophisticated AI-capable application.
This sample application is designed to demo the usage of some of the AWS AI Services to enrich your existing .NET applications with AI capabilities using AWS SDK for .NET.

The following services are used in the demos:
- Amazon Comprehend
- Amazon Translate
- Amazon Textract and Textract Query
- Amazon Rekognition
